        <p>You'll have to write <span class="highlight secondary-highlight">long text</span> many times, and the <span class="highlight tertiary-highlight">visitor won't have time</span> to read through what you have written. In such a case, you can <span class="highlight">use highlights</span> very wisely on specific keywords so you can effectively <span class="highlight secondary-highlight">get your message across</span> in the user's brief attention span and really make a difference!</p>
